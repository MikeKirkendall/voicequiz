# Superpowered SDK Voice Processing Architecture

This research provides a comprehensive architecture plan for building a professional voice processing research application using Superpowered SDK. The analysis reveals that **Superpowered SDK delivers near-native performance through WebAssembly while solving fundamental Web Audio API limitations** that caused your previous infinite recursion issues.

## Core SDK architecture and capabilities

Superpowered SDK operates on a **WebAssembly foundation** that provides 90-95% of native performance while maintaining cross-browser compatibility. The architecture uses **linear memory management** with explicit cleanup patterns, eliminating the garbage collection issues that plague Web Audio implementations.

**Key architectural advantages:**
- **Unified processing context**: All audio processing occurs within a single WebAssembly environment, eliminating the complex audio graph management of Web Audio
- **Predictable performance**: Consistent behavior across all browsers with sub-10ms latency achievable
- **Professional feature set**: Complete DSP library including advanced pitch shifting, formant preservation, and professional-grade effects
- **Memory efficiency**: Direct linear memory access eliminates the copying overhead inherent in Web Audio's non-interleaved approach

The SDK initialization follows a **three-phase pattern**: license validation with SuperpoweredGlue, AudioContext creation via SuperpoweredWebAudio helpers, and standard AudioWorkletNode deployment. This approach automatically handles browser compatibility by falling back to optimized ScriptProcessorNode implementations where AudioWorklets aren't available.

## Clean architecture plan for voice processing research

The optimal architecture follows a **Pipe and Filter pattern** specifically designed for audio processing pipelines. This modular approach enables independent testing, debugging, and optimization of each processing stage while maintaining research-grade audio quality.

### Recommended architecture structure

**1. Processing Pipeline Organization**
Each of your four versions should implement a dedicated AudioWorkletProcessor with the following structure:

```javascript
class VoiceResearchProcessor extends SuperpoweredWebAudio.AudioWorkletProcessor {
  onReady() {
    // Initialize processing objects using this.Superpowered context
    this.pitchShifter = new this.Superpowered.PitchShifter(this.samplerate);
    this.compressor = new this.Superpowered.Compressor(this.samplerate);
    this.filter = new this.Superpowered.Filter(this.samplerate);
    this.eq = new this.Superpowered.EQ(this.samplerate);
    
    // Processing buffers
    this.inputBuffer = new this.Superpowered.Float32Buffer(2048);
    this.outputBuffer = new this.Superpowered.Float32Buffer(2048);
  }
  
  onDestruct() {
    // Clean up all Superpowered objects
    if (this.pitchShifter) this.pitchShifter.destruct();
    if (this.compressor) this.compressor.destruct();
    if (this.filter) this.filter.destruct();
    if (this.eq) this.eq.destruct();
    if (this.inputBuffer) this.inputBuffer.free();
    if (this.outputBuffer) this.outputBuffer.free();
  }
  
  processAudio(inputBuffer, outputBuffer, buffersize) {
    // Execute processing chain with proper Superpowered methods
    this.executeProcessingChain(inputBuffer, outputBuffer, buffersize);
  }
}
```

**2. Research-Grade Processing Chain Design**
Structure each version with clearly defined stages that can be bypassed for A/B testing:

- **Version A (Baseline)**: Direct passthrough with no processing (control condition)
- **Version B (Bone Conduction Match)**: Bandpass Filter (300-1200Hz) → Pitch Shift (-120Hz) → EQ (+3dB@500Hz, -3dB@2kHz) → Light Compression (2:1)
- **Version C (Inner Voice)**: Low-pass Filter (1.2kHz) → High Shelf (-6dB@1kHz) → Pitch Shift (-120Hz) → Soft Compression (1.5:1) → Narrow Stereo
- **Version D (Enhanced Presence)**: Bandpass Filter (200-3000Hz) → Pitch Shift (-100Hz) → EQ (+2dB@800Hz) → Heavy Compression (3.5:1) → Harmonic Saturation → Light Reverb

**3. Memory Management Strategy**
Implement **Resource Acquisition Is Initialization (RAII)** patterns with explicit cleanup:

```javascript
class ProcessingStage {
  constructor(sampleRate) {
    // Use this.Superpowered context in AudioWorklet
    this.processor = new this.Superpowered.PitchShifter(sampleRate);
    this.buffer = new this.Superpowered.Float32Buffer(2048);
  }
  
  destruct() {
    // Proper Superpowered cleanup
    if (this.processor) this.processor.destruct();
    if (this.buffer) this.buffer.free();
  }
}
```

## Voice processing implementation specifications

**Frequency-Based Pitch Shifting with Formant Preservation**
For research-grade bone conduction simulation, use **frequency-based pitch shifting** (-120Hz for Versions B&C, -100Hz for Version D) rather than cent-based shifting. Implement **formant preservation** to maintain natural voice characteristics while simulating bone conduction frequency response.

**Bone Conduction Frequency Response (Version B)**
Implement precise **bandpass filtering (300-1200Hz)** to simulate skull-to-cochlea transmission. Apply **EQ curve with +3dB at 500Hz and -3dB at 2kHz** to match bone conduction frequency response characteristics. Use **light compression (2:1 ratio)** to simulate the dynamic range compression inherent in bone conduction.

**Inner Voice Simulation (Version C)**
Model thought-like perception with **low-pass filtering at 1.2kHz** combined with **high shelf attenuation (-6dB above 1kHz)**. Apply **softer compression (1.5:1 ratio)** and **narrow stereo positioning** to create "in-head" localization characteristic of internal voice perception.

**Enhanced Presence (Version D)**
Create assertive voice quality with **broader bandpass filtering (200-3000Hz)** and **presence boost (+2dB at 800Hz)**. Apply **aggressive compression (3.5:1 ratio)** for punch, **subtle harmonic saturation** for warmth, and **light room reverb** for spatial presence.

## Avoiding Web Audio API pitfalls

Your previous infinite recursion issues stem from **fundamental Web Audio API limitations** that Superpowered SDK specifically addresses:

**Memory Management Problems Solved**
Web Audio's biggest issue is **AudioBuffer memory leaks** where decoded audio persists for the entire browser tab lifecycle. A 600KB MP3 can consume 80-90MB in memory, eventually crashing memory-limited devices. Superpowered's **linear memory management** with explicit cleanup eliminates these issues.

**Threading and Performance Issues Resolved**
Web Audio's **ScriptProcessorNode runs on the main thread**, causing blocking operations that interfere with audio stability. Even simple operations create noticeable latency. Superpowered's **AudioWorklet integration** with WebAssembly processing ensures dedicated audio thread execution without main thread interference.

**Garbage Collection Interference Eliminated**
The most critical issue is **JavaScript garbage collection running synchronously on AudioWorklet threads**, causing audio dropouts and clicking sounds. Superpowered's **WebAssembly sandbox** isolates audio processing from JavaScript's garbage collection, ensuring predictable performance.

## Performance optimization and memory management

**Real-Time Processing Constraints**
Target **under 10ms total system latency** for interactive applications. Keep CPU usage below 70-75% to prevent audio artifacts. Use **pre-allocation strategies** during initialization - never allocate memory in audio processing callbacks.

**Buffer Management Strategy**
Implement **circular buffer patterns** for all audio data flow between threads. Use **double/triple buffering** with ping-pong mechanisms to avoid blocking operations. For your research application, 128-256 sample buffers provide optimal balance between latency and CPU efficiency.

**Threading Architecture**
Separate **real-time audio threads** from **control threads** completely. Use **lock-free communication** via atomic operations and lock-free FIFO queues for parameter updates. Never use mutexes in audio callbacks - Superpowered's MessagePort pattern handles this correctly.

## Research-grade quality implementation

**Audio Quality Standards**
Process at **48kHz minimum** with **32-bit floating point** internal processing. For extreme pitch manipulation, consider **96kHz processing** with **64-bit accumulation** for mathematical operations. Maintain **signal-to-noise ratio above 80dB** and **THD+N under 0.01%** for professional-grade results.

**Quality Preservation Techniques**
Implement **proper gain staging** maintaining -18dBFS average levels throughout the processing chain. Use **linear phase EQ** for corrective work and **minimum phase** for creative processing. Monitor **phase correlation** throughout the chain to prevent cumulative phase distortion.

**Algorithm Performance Optimization**
Use **SIMD instructions** for parallel sample processing, **pre-compute lookup tables** during initialization, and implement **FFT optimization** using Superpowered's built-in frequency domain processing capabilities.

## SDK Integration Best Practices

**Initialization Pattern**
```javascript
// Main thread initialization
const { SuperpoweredGlue, SuperpoweredWebAudio } = await import('@superpoweredsdk/web');
const superpowered = await SuperpoweredGlue.Instantiate('ExampleLicenseKey-WillExpire-OnNextUpdate');
const audioContext = new AudioContext();
const webaudioManager = new SuperpoweredWebAudio(audioContext.sampleRate, superpowered);

// AudioWorklet loading
await audioContext.audioWorklet.addModule('/scripts/voice-processor-worklet.js');
const workletNode = new AudioWorkletNode(audioContext, 'VoiceProcessor');
```

**AudioWorklet Implementation Pattern**
```javascript
// In voice-processor-worklet.js
import { SuperpoweredWebAudio } from "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@superpoweredsdk/web@2.7.2";

class VoiceProcessor extends SuperpoweredWebAudio.AudioWorkletProcessor {
  // Implementation using this.Superpowered context
}

registerProcessor('VoiceProcessor', VoiceProcessor);
```
